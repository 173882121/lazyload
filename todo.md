TODO
====

* Use gulp instead of grunt
    * Transpile and bundle to dist/lazyload.min and minified to dist/lazyload.min.js
    * Bonus: in addition, don't transpile but bundle to dist/lazyload.es2015.js
* Make tests work again
    * Test transpiled and bundled file's public functions (mocking dependencies)
    * Test unbundled modules singularly (transpiled?)
