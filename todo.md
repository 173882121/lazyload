TODO
====

* [TEST] Test the `img:not(.selected)` default value for option elements_selector on IE8!
* [DEMO] Finish the dynamic demo page using the brand new update method
* [PERF] Stop listening to "scroll" when 0 elements remains, restart listening after content was added!
* [SUPP] It doesn't work on IE7 because it doesn't support querySelectorAll. Create a fallback? Load them all somehow? Drop IE7 support?
* [NERD] Convert to coffeescript?
