## Include the script

[Include the script from cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/vanilla-lazyload), or [download it from the `dist` folder](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload/tree/master/dist). The file you typically want to use is `lazyload.transpiled.min.js`. 

You can also download it and stick it in your project using `npm install vanilla-lazyload` or `bower install vanilla-lazyload`.

So for example:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vanilla-lazyload/7.2.0/lazyload.transpiled.min.js"></script>
```

You could also include it using an `async` script, see the use cases below.
